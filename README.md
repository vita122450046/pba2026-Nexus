Benchmarking PyCaret AutoML Against LSTM for Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data
Abstract

Sentiment analysis is an important task in the field of Natural Language Processing that aims to determine the emotional tone expressed in textual data. With the rapid growth of social media platforms, large volumes of user-generated content provide valuable insights into public opinion. This project investigates the effectiveness of traditional Machine Learning models compared to Deep Learning approaches for sentiment classification.

The dataset used in this study is the Sentiment140 Dataset, which contains approximately 1.6 million labeled tweets. Machine Learning models are developed using PyCaret to benchmark several algorithms automatically. The results are compared with a Deep Learning model based on the LSTM architecture. The performance of each model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

1. Introduction

The increasing use of social media platforms has generated a large amount of textual data that reflects users' opinions and sentiments. Extracting meaningful insights from such data requires automated techniques capable of analyzing and classifying textual information. Sentiment analysis has therefore become an important research area in Natural Language Processing.

Machine Learning techniques such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine have traditionally been used for sentiment classification. However, recent advances in Deep Learning have introduced models capable of capturing complex semantic relationships within text data. Recurrent neural networks, particularly Long Short-Term Memory networks, have demonstrated strong performance in various Natural Language Processing tasks.

This project aims to compare the performance of Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches for sentiment analysis using Twitter data. The main contribution of this study is to evaluate multiple Machine Learning algorithms using PyCaret and compare them with an LSTM-based model.

2. Related Work

Several studies have explored sentiment analysis using different machine learning and deep learning approaches. Traditional machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression have been widely used due to their efficiency and relatively good performance on text classification tasks.

Recent research has shown that deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks and transformer-based models can outperform traditional approaches by capturing contextual information within sequences of words. In particular, LSTM networks are capable of learning long-term dependencies in text data, which makes them suitable for sentiment analysis.

Many studies have also applied automated machine learning frameworks to benchmark multiple models efficiently. PyCaret provides an effective environment for comparing several machine learning models and selecting the best-performing one.

3. Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Sentiment140 Dataset.

This dataset contains approximately 1.6 million tweets that were automatically labeled according to emoticons used in the tweets.

Dataset structure:

Column	Description
target	Sentiment label
id	Tweet identifier
date	Date of tweet
flag	Query flag
user	Username
text	Tweet content

Sentiment labels:

Label	Meaning
0	Negative sentiment
4	Positive sentiment

For this project, the labels are converted into a binary classification format:

0 = Negative
1 = Positive

Data preprocessing includes cleaning and normalizing the tweet text to prepare it for model training.

4. Methodology

The methodology of this project consists of several stages, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, machine learning modeling, and deep learning modeling.

4.1 Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps include:

Converting text to lowercase

Removing URLs and special characters

Removing punctuation

Removing stopwords

Tokenization

Example:

Original text

I LOVE this movie!!!

Cleaned text

love movie
4.2 Machine Learning Pipeline

Machine Learning models are developed using the PyCaret framework.

The following algorithms are evaluated:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machine

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Text data is transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization before being used for model training.

4.3 Deep Learning Architecture

The Deep Learning model implemented in this project is based on the LSTM architecture.

Model architecture:

Text Input

Output Layer

The LSTM model is trained to capture sequential relationships within the tweet text and classify the sentiment accordingly.

5. Experiments

Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of both Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.

The evaluation process includes:

Training multiple machine learning models using PyCaret

Selecting the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics

Training the LSTM model using the same dataset

Comparing the results obtained from both approaches

Evaluation metrics used in this project include:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

Hyperparameter tuning is also applied to improve model performance.

6. Results and Discussion

The experimental results provide a comparative evaluation of Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.

A benchmark table is used to compare the performance of different models based on evaluation metrics. Machine Learning models typically provide faster training times, while Deep Learning models may achieve higher accuracy due to their ability to capture contextual relationships within text sequences.

The results highlight the strengths and limitations of each approach for sentiment analysis on Twitter data.

7. Conclusion

This project presents a comparative study between Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches for sentiment analysis on Twitter data. Machine Learning models are benchmarked using PyCaret, while Deep Learning models are implemented using an LSTM architecture.

The results demonstrate that both approaches are capable of performing sentiment classification effectively, with Deep Learning models potentially offering improved performance for large-scale text datasets.

Future work may include exploring transformer-based architectures such as BERT to further improve sentiment classification performance.Benchmarking PyCaret AutoML Against LSTM for Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data
